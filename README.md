# Drug Overdose Deaths Analysis

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of data-driven insights and effective visualization techniques applied to a real-world dataset. Our primary focus was analyzing the **Drug Overdose Deaths** dataset, leveraging data analytics techniques to derive meaningful insights and present them visually.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Ensured data accuracy by handling missing values and standardizing formats.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Identified trends in deaths in cities, exploited drugs, and the distribution of injuries in counties using statistical methods.

- **Visualization Techniques:**
  - Created interactive and static visualizations using tools like **Matplotlib** and **Tableau**.
  - Developed dynamic visualizations using **Plotly**.

- **Insights Derived:**
  - Conducted a detailed analysis of drug overdose patterns by gender, race, and age.
  - Visualized the distribution of deaths across all US counties over a 10-year period.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Tableau
- Machine Learning (for further analysis)

## Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates how data analysis can be leveraged to uncover critical insights from real-world datasets, offering a clear understanding of the factors influencing drug overdose deaths.
